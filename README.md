# Hometune

Hometune is a fun website where you make a profile and can look at local venues, artists, and concerts around the Seattle area. The user can sort the venues, artists, and concerts pages by many different categories such as alphabetical order, location, genre, etc. Once the user is on a specific venue or artist, they can comment on their page and look at other users comments.

## Installation

Follow the website (https://github.com/noaheakin/hometune-app). Fork the repository and clone the https url to your terminal. Once that has been done run

```ruby
install bundle
```
to make sure you have all the gems needed. 

## Run
To run the progam, run 

```ruby
rails s
```
in the terminal. Once that has worked, type in (http://localhost:3000/homepage) into your web browser. 

## Usage

Only a user with a profile will have access to the functionality of the website. The user can create a profile or login into an existing profile. Once a profile has been signed in or created, the user will be directed to the homepage. From the homepage, the user can explore the venue, artist, or concert branches. 

Each of these paths have a number of filters to easily access the information with the most relevance for them. Additionally, a user can make comments to an artist or venue page.

The user can access the homepage, their profile, or logout by pressing the buttons at the top of the page.
